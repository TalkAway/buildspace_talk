Check in and check out of each experience

# Student Journey

**For all students**


After checking in, the student sees the Journey logbook:

Each lesson, the student writes down the main topics talked about on the walk; the tutor responds in a comment and checks in the student's writing. 

After the check, the student gets an NFT record of the walkthrough, for regular students,
that is included in the history of the change of level certificate (onchain) 

**Regular students**

Below the note space there will be 4 topics with the skills needed for level change, 

The tutor will check each of them according to the student's process. 

When they are all filled in, the student receives the SBT of proficiency level (onchain), but each level certification
only can be released with at minimum 8 walking lessons.

The students can schedule a free online meeting for proficiency evaluation and start in a specific level.

Each writing on the hikes will accumulate, building up a big notebook and go into a specific folder (offchain)

**For all students**

Will have a phrases propose while the walking, the student will choose if he is on street or in a coffee, for exemple,
and each 10 minutoes the app will suggest a phrase like this: "stop and look the heaven" or "touch the table and indentificate your material" 
- for each level we will generate a kind of phrase propose.
