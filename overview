# buildspace_talk
This is the space for our first MVP in web3

Casula lessons - certified lessons - tour guide + language lesson.

SociaFi to promove clutural interchange, with country guilds and rewards for cultural content. 

* OVERVIEW

Talk Away is a social impact language learning startup that offers a unique and immersive learning experience. 
Our innovative approach involves learning languages through walking and exploring the city, making language learning both fun and practical.

As a teaching platform on the web3, we are building a dapp and a metaverse prototype to further expand access to language learning. 
We haven't chosen a location to deploy yet, we would like to use blockchain's decentralized metaverse infrastructure. 
Like efinity or other parachain metaverses projects.

Our mission is to provide a differentiated teaching approach 
to promote language knowledge for people with limited financial resources and migratory vulnerability. 
We also aim to connect people from all over the world, fostering greater awareness of global cultural diversity.
